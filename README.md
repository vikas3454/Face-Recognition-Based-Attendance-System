**Face Recognition Based Attendance System**

**Description**

This project is designed for industries to track the attendance of their employees using face recognition technology. Utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face detection, the system allows for the automatic logging of attendance. The project is built using Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth and interactive user interface.
